            <dl>Corned beef is meat that has been cured in a salt solution. Before refrigeration, meat was salted and cured to be preserved. Historically, any type of meat could be put through the curing process that makes what we know as corned beef today.</dl>

         <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
        
         <ol>
            <li>Potatoes: If using, peel and dice the potatoes into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: Dice any additional vegetables you want to include.</li>
            <li>Cook the Potatoes (if using) Heat a pan over medium heat and add a little oil or butter.</li>
            <li>Add the diced potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden and tender. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add diced onions and cook until they are translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, being careful not to burn it.</li>
            <li>Open the can of corned beef and add it to the pan. You can break it up with a spatula or fork as it heats.</li>
            <li>Add any additional vegetables like peas, carrots, or bell peppers. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add a splash of Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Cook everything together until the corned beef is heated through and the vegetables are tender, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the corned beef hot, directly from the pan. It pairs well with rice, bread, or as a filling for sandwiches.</li>
