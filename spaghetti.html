            <dl>Spaghetti (Italian: [spa'gtti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.</dl>

         <ul>
            <p>For the Pasta:</p>
            <li>Spaghetti (about 2 ounces per person, but adjust based on appetite).</li>
            <p>For the Sauce:</p>
            <li>Olive oil (2-3 tablespoons).</li>
            <li>Garlic (2-3 cloves, minced).</li>
            <li>Onion (1, chopped).</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes (1 can, usually 14.5 ounces, crushed or whole and then crushed).</li>
            <li>Tomato paste (2 tablespoons, optional for thicker sauce).</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste).</li>
            <li>Black pepper (to taste).</li>
            <li>Dried basil (1 teaspoon) or fresh basil (a few leaves, chopped).</li>
            <li>Dried oregano (1 teaspoon) or fresh oregano (a few leaves, chopped).</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for heat).</li>
            <li>Sugar (a pinch, optional, to balance acidity).</li>
         </ul>
         <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
        
         <ol>
            <p>Prepare the Pasta:</p>
            <li>Boil Water: Fill a large pot with water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Cook Spaghetti: Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook according to the package instructions (usually around 8-12 minutes) until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain Pasta: Once cooked, drain the spaghetti in a colander. You can reserve a small cup of pasta water to adjust the sauce later if needed.</li>
         </ol>
         <ol>
            <p>Make the Sauce:</p>
            <li>Heat Oil: While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook Aromatics: Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Tomatoes: Stir in canned tomatoes. If using whole tomatoes, break them up with a spoon or use a hand blender for a smoother texture. Add tomato paste if you want a thicker sauce.</li>
            <li>Season: Add salt, black pepper, dried basil, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir well.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If the sauce is too acidic, you can add a pinch of sugar to balance it out.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <p>Combine and Serve:</p>
            <li>Mix Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat well. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve: Plate the spaghetti and top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley.</li>
