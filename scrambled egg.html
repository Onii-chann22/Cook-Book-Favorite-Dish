         <ul>
            <li>Eggs 4 large.</li>
            <li>Milk or Cream 2-3 tablespoons (optional, for creaminess).</li>
            <li>Salt 1/4 teaspoon (or to taste).</li>
            <li>Black Pepper 1/4 teaspoon (or to taste).</li>
            <li>Butter or Oil 1-2 tablespoons (for cooking).</li>
            
            
         </ul>
         <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
        
         <ol>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-low heat..</li>
            <li>Add butter or oil and let it melt and coat the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
            <li>Let the eggs sit undisturbed for a few seconds until they start to set around the edges.</li>
            <li>Gently stir and fold the eggs with a spatula, pushing them from the edges towards the center. This helps create soft, fluffy curds.</li>
            <li>Continue gently stirring and folding the eggs until they are mostly set but still slightly runny. The residual heat will finish cooking them.</li>
            <li>Avoid over-stirring, as it can make the eggs tough.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your desired consistency, remove them from the pan immediately to prevent overcooking.</li>
            <li>Taste and Serve.</li>
            
         </ol>
