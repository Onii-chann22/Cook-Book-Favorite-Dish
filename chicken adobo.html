         <h3 style="text-align: left; color: rgb(182, 33, 115);">Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 kg 1 (2.2 lbs) chicken thighs or drumsticks, cut into pieces.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vinegar (white or cane vinegar works best).</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced.</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaves.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional, adjust to taste).</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
         </ul>
         <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
        
         <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, and a few bay leaves. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the marinade) and sear the chicken pieces until browned on all sides. This step adds depth to the flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onion to the pot and saut√© until softened.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water and add the whole peppercorns. If using, add the optional ingredients like fish sauce, oyster sauce, or tomato paste at this stage. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>If you're adding potatoes, stir them in about 15-20 minutes before the end of cooking, so they cook through and absorb some of the sauce flavors.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or additional sugar if needed. Once the chicken is tender and the sauce is to your desired consistency, remove from heat and ready to serve.</li>
         </ol>
