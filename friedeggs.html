        <ul>
            <li>Eggs as many as you want to cook.</li>
            <li>Butter or Oil 1-2 tablespoons (for frying).</li>
            <li>Salt To taste.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>

        <ol>
            <p style="color: blueviolet;">Heat the Pan:</p>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the butter or oil. Let it melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 31, 31);">Crack the Eggs:</p>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl one at a time to avoid any shell bits getting into the pan. If you're confident, you can crack them directly into the pan.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the eggs into the pan, one at a time.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <p style="color: darkslateblue;">Cook the Eggs:</p>
            <li>Sunny-Side Up let the eggs cook undisturbed until the whites are fully set but the yolks remain runny. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Over-Easy/Medium/Hard: If you prefer your yolks cooked through or with a slightly firmer consistency, flip the eggs gently using a spatula and cook for an additional 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on how well-done you want the yolk.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

             <ul>
                <li>1 kg 1 (2.2 lbs) chicken thighs or drumsticks, cut into pieces.</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce.</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vinegar (white or cane vinegar works best).</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water.</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil.</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional, adjust to taste).</li>

             <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
            
             <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, and a few bay leaves. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the marinade) and sear the chicken pieces until browned on all sides. This step adds depth to the flavor.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced onion to the pot and sauté until softened.</li>
                <li>Pour in the water and add the whole peppercorns. If using, add the optional ingredients like fish sauce, oyster sauce, or tomato paste at this stage. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>If you're adding potatoes, stir them in about 15-20 minutes before the end of cooking, so they cook through and absorb some of the sauce flavors.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or additional sugar if needed. Once the chicken is tender and the sauce is to your desired consistency, remove from heat and ready to serve.</li>

        <li>Add butter or oil and let it melt and coat the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the eggs sit undisturbed for a few seconds until they start to set around the edges.</li>
        <li>Gently stir and fold the eggs with a spatula, pushing them from the edges towards the center. This helps create soft, fluffy curds.</li>
        <li>Continue gently stirring and folding the eggs until they are mostly set but still slightly runny. The residual heat will finish cooking them.</li>
        <li>Avoid over-stirring, as it can make the eggs tough.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your desired consistency, remove them from the pan immediately to prevent overcooking.</li>
        <li>Taste and Serve.</li>

     <ul>
        <p>For the Pasta:</p>
        <li>Spaghetti (about 2 ounces per person, but adjust based on appetite).</li>

        <li>Olive oil (2-3 tablespoons).</li>
        <li>Garlic (2-3 cloves, minced).</li>
        <li>Onion (1, chopped).</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes (1 can, usually 14.5 ounces, crushed or whole and then crushed).</li>
        <li>Tomato paste (2 tablespoons, optional for thicker sauce).</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste).</li>
        <li>Black pepper (to taste).</li>
        <li>Dried basil (1 teaspoon) or fresh basil (a few leaves, chopped).</li>
        <li>Dried oregano (1 teaspoon) or fresh oregano (a few leaves, chopped).</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for heat).</li>
        <li>Sugar (a pinch, optional, to balance acidity).</li>
     </ul>
     <p style="color: darkblue;">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
    
     <ol>
        <p>Prepare the Pasta:</p>
        <li>Boil Water: Fill a large pot with water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Cook Spaghetti: Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook according to the package instructions (usually around 8-12 minutes) until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain Pasta: Once cooked, drain the spaghetti in a colander. You can reserve a small cup of pasta water to adjust the sauce later if needed.</li>
     </ol>
     <ol>
        <p>Make the Sauce:</p>
        <li>Heat Oil: While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook Aromatics: Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes: Stir in canned tomatoes. If using whole tomatoes, break them up with a spoon or use a hand blender for a smoother texture. Add tomato paste if you want a thicker sauce.</li>
        <li>Season: Add salt, black pepper, dried basil, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir well.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If the sauce is too acidic, you can add a pinch of sugar to balance it out.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
        <p>Combine and Serve:</p>
        <li>Mix Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat well. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve: Plate the spaghetti and top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley.</li>
